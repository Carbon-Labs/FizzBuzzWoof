# FizzBuzzWoof [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Carbon-Labs/FizzBuzzWoof.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Carbon-Labs/FizzBuzzWoof) [![Build Status](https://dockunit.io/svg/Carbon-Labs/FizzBuzzWoof?master&1448022201550)](https://dockunit.io/projects/Carbon-Labs/FizzBuzzWoof)
A Fizz Buzz Woof implementation in Rust

You can directly enter the a range of numbers you want to print out.

Example:

```
$ 15 20
Buzz Fizz Buzz
16
Woof
Fizz
19
Buzz
```

Here's a way you could only print out one number:

```
$ 233334
Fizz Fizz Fizz Fizz Fizz
```
To exit (if you don't want to press ^C):

```
$ exit
```

# Compilation

### Prerequisites
[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html)


Usually, when you install Rust, Cargo, the project manager, is installed, too. However, if it is not, just [Install Cargo Manually](https://crates.io/install). The only time when Cargo was not installed (at least for me) was when I used `pacman -S rust`.

### Running (and Building)

Run:
```cargo run```
